Overview: Finding jobs that match one's interests and skill level is a difficult undertaking for job searchers. The issues emerge from a lack of understanding of the organization's goal, work culture, and existing employment opportunities. Furthermore, for any organization's recruiters, identifying the perfect individual with the needed qualities to fill their current job opportunities is a critical duty. Online Job fair Portals have made job hunting much more convenient for both parties. Job Portal is a solution that brings together recruiters and job seekers to meet their specific needs. They are the cheapest and fastest means of communication, reaching a vast range of people with only a single click, regardless of their geographical location.
The web application "Job fair Portal" provides a simple and convenient search application for job seekers to locate their ideal employment and for recruiters to identify the best candidates. Job seekers from all walks of life can use this site to look for current jobs. Job searchers can use the program to register and update their information and skill set. They can look for available employment and apply for the ones that interest them. Employers can sign up for the app and list their current positions. They can look at the job applications and screen them for the best match. Users can provide a review for an organization and discuss their interview experience, which Employers can see.
